# House_Linear_Regression
SaveHTML2file.py asks the user for a website to webscrape and puts it in a text file.
I put used to websites and I put them into houses.txt and houses1.txt.

I use TxtParse.py to parse through the html and find relevant house details like the price, 
number of bedrooms/ bathrooms, square footage, etc.
Then I put that infomation into two textfiles. all_houses.txt and all_houses_num.txt. 
all_houses.txt has all the information without any changes to the data. 
all_houses_num.txt has the categorical information changed into numeric.

House_Analysis.R is where I created the model
I was trying to predict the price of a house and my model did a really good job
